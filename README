A cross platform, simple, read/write driven, web server with adjustable permissions. Heavily influenced by superstar. This is still in development.

Uses Mongoose (included).
	https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose

Library Dependencies:
	None.

OS Dependencies:
	None (well...if you want to use the makefile...then a makefile runner...).

How to build and run:
	make
	./lonestar

Optional Arguments:
	./lonestar --ip X.X.X.X --port X --permissions X --help

	IP is a standard IPv4 address.
	Port is a standard TCP port (0-65535).
	Permissions is a bit field (read=4, write=2, exec=1).
	Help shows a help menu similar to this.

Examples:
	Run lonestar on localhost:8081 with read/write permissions:
		./lonestar --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 --permissions 6

	Run lonestar on any IP on port 8080 with read only permissions (this is the default option, so the two commands below are equivalent):
		./lonestar --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --permissions 4
		./lonestar
