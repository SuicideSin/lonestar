A cross platform, simple, read/write driven, web server with adjustable permissions. Heavily influenced by superstar. This is still in development.

Uses Mongoose (included).
	https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose

Library Dependencies:
	None.

OS Dependencies:
	None (well...if you want to use the makefile...then a makefile runner...).

How to build and run:
	make
	./lonestar

Optional Arguments:
	./lonestar --ip X.X.X.X --port X --permissions X --web_root X --help

	IP is a standard IPv4 address.
	Port is a standard TCP port (0-65535).
	Permissions is a bit field (read=4, write=2, exec=1).
	Web root X is the folder where "/" is looked for web requests.
	Help shows a help menu similar to this.

Examples:
	Run lonestar on localhost:8081 with web root in folder "root" with read/write permissions:
		./lonestar --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 --web_root root --permissions 6

	Run lonestar on any IP on port 8080 with web root in folder "web" with read only permissions
	Note, this is the default option, so the two commands below are equivalent:
		./lonestar --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --web_root web --permissions 4
		./lonestar
